    <p class={styles.about__paragraph}>I'm currently studying computer science with a major in Artificial Intelligence. Over the last 2 years, I have been an entrepreneur selling websites to local businesses, generating over â‚¬7,000 in profits. Through this experience, I've developed a strong background in front-end development. I decided to pursue a career in AI as I believe it represents the future of technology, especially in sectors like healthcare.</p>
